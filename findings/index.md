title: W3C TAG Findings
---

At its 4 Nov 2002 teleconference, the TAG agreed to adopt the following policy for managing findings.

A finding draft should be treated like a W3C technical report:

* After announcement of a draft, we don't modify it.
* Each draft has a latest/this version URI and links to the previous version.
* The status section of a finding draft indicates whether the document is a draft/for review in light of TAG consensus/ approved by the TAG.

Having approved a finding:

* For minor changes thereafter, we continue to publish updates using the same "latest version URI" (i.e., it remains part of the same document series). It is possible for the latest version of the series to be "not yet approved". That should be a temporary state, however. Findings in an intermediate state should refer to the previous approved version.
* For major changes, we can start a new series (with a different "latest version URI"). If we start a new series, the new series should explain its relation to the old one (e.g., whether the new series supersedes the old series).
