## TAG Work Mode

The TAG's formal work, including issue and change tracking for our deliverables, is largely happening in Github. So if you have a specific issue with one of the documents the TAG is working on or has published, we encourage you to open an issue against that document on Github or, if you feel so inclined, fork our work and send us a pull request.



###TAG Public Mailing List Code of Conduct

The TAG uses our public mailing list for most technical discussion, in the interest of transparency and to foster engagement with the community. We therefore encourage the community to pose questions, make proposals for new work and discuss our current work items on the TAG mailing list. 

In doing so, we ask that those who participate on the mailing list understand:

* The primary focus of the www-tag list is the current and potential work items of the TAG.

* Conference announcements, software releases, bugs and the like are not appropriate for this list – even if they are related to Web architecture.

* Likewise, www-tag is not a general Web architecture discussion list.

* Some issues may be better handled by a specific Working Group; if this is the case, we will ask for discussion to be moved there.

* The TAG determines what work items we adopt and approve; while we appreciate input from the public, we are under no obligation to adopt or approve any idea.

* There is no such thing as “consensus of the TAG list”, since the TAG is not a traditional Working Group; the current members of the TAG solely determine its consensus.

* TAG members will read e-mail on www-tag with best effort, but are under no obligation to respond to messages here.

* Messages on this list are forwarded to thousands of busy people, so please keep them brief and on-topic. Refrain from sending long stories, aphorisms, etc., even if you feel that they bolster your argument.

* We reserve the right to ban those who persistently post off-topic messages, unsolicited commercial e-mail, those who are disrespectful of others, and those we consider to be “trolls.”
