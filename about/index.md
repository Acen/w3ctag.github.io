title: What is the TAG?
---

The TAG is a special working group within the W3C, chartered (under the [W3C Process Document](http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/organization.html#TAG)) with stewardship of the Web architecture.

As outlined in our [charter](http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-tag-charter.html), there are three aspects to this mission:

* to document and build consensus around principles of Web architecture and to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary;
* to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the TAG;
* to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside W3C.

The TAG has 9 participants (5 elected, 3 appointed, and 1 chair) plus a staff contact:

* Tim Berners-Lee (W3C) (Chair)
* Daniel Appelquist (Telef√≥nica) (Chair)<sup>1</sup>
* Domenic Denicola (Google)<sup>4</sup>

* Yves Lafon (W3C) (staff contact)
* Peter Linss (HP) (Chair)<sup>1</sup>
* Mark Nottingham (Akamai)<sup>4</sup>
