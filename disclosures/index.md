## Making Disclosures

[Section 4.2 of the W3C Process Document](http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/comm.html#ipr) explains:

> To disclose patent and IPR claims, individuals MUST send email to patent-issues@w3.org, which is an archived mailing list readable by Members and the Team. Individuals disclosing knowledge of IPR claims SHOULD copy the Team Contact responsible for a particular technology to ensure that the disclosure receives prompt consideration. Individuals MAY also copy other recipients.

**Note:** As of May 2003, W3C has approved a new patent policy. The TAG is expected to adopt the approved policy with the rest of W3C when the policy becomes operational.
