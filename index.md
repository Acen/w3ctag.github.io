# TAG Current Work

This page tracks the [W3C TAG's](http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/) current work items.

## Specification Reviews

As part of our regular work, we review W3C and other Web-related specifications. See the [spec reviews repo](https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews).


##  Draft Findings

One of the main kinds of TAG deliverables is a "finding" -- a statement about the architecture of the Web. We are currently working on the following findings:

* [Securing the Web](https://w3ctag.github.io/web-https/)

## TAG-Driven Specifications

The TAG also incubates specifications that it believes are important, with the expectation that a Working Group will assume control of them. The TAG is currently incubating:

* [Packaging on the Web](https://github.com/w3ctag/packaging-on-the-web)
* [Capability URLs](https://github.com/w3ctag/capability-urls)


## Documentation

Finally, we also produce various bits of documentation, including:

* [Promises Guide](https://github.com/w3ctag/promises-guide)
* [Extensible Web Report Card](https://w3ctag.github.io/extensible-web-report-card)
