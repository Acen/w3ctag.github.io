### 1. Specification Reviews

We will review any Web-related specification brought to us for architectural issues. This includes not only W3C specifications, but also external ones.

Before you open a review, it may be helpful to have a look at:

* [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)
* [Writing Promise-Using Specifications](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)
* [Privacy and Security Self-Review Questionnaire](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/)

To open a review issue, see our [specification reviews repository](https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews).

Please understand that a completed specification review does not necessarily mean that the TAG supports your document, or that it is free from architectural issues. We focus on giving constructive feedback to specification authors, not acting as an gatekeeper.


### 2. Extensible Web Summit

Periodically, the TAG holds events to gather different parts of the community to discuss experiences with the Web Platform, current work, and future developments.

These are great opportunities to not only engage with the TAG, but also a wider set of developers, users and Web technologists. 

See the [Extensible Web Summit](https://extensiblewebsummit.org/) site for more information.


### 3. TAG at TPAC

During TPAC, TAG members attend Working Group sessions to help them understand what's going on in different parts of the W3C, and to offer feedback and guidance.

You can request that TAG members be present if you think it will help move your discussions forward; depending on the nature of the issue, this might include some or all of the TAG. 

Keep in mind that (like many other people), we're pretty busy during TPAC, so please request such a meeting as early as you can by contacting the TAG chairs.


### 4. The www-tag Mailing List

Issues that aren't related to a specification can be discussed on the [www-tag mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/). Note that this is also used as a general discussion list for Web architecture, and so if you need a response from the TAG, it's best to get something into the [spec reviews issue tracker](https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews).
